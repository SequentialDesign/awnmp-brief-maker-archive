# Goal

This is meant to be used with my (Julia-PBN) serial-steno brief maker.

It is to give insight of some patterns, and getting used to it.

# How it works

There are three folders, `exercice`, `solution` and `expected`. The title of each exercices are <number>.txt, its corresponding solution is <number>.txt and the expected results are <number>.txt

Be careful, solutions in `solution` doesn't work as in. They follow the following syntax:

```
general code of your main path

--- (Optional)
// functions.jl

general function code

--- (Optional)
// consts.jl

general constants

```

The `expected` part is to see if you understood the exercice, without spoiling yourself with the solution.

# Misc

If you find any error, want to share your solutions or want to add some exercices, feel free to ping me on discord.
