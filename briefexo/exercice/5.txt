The problem is that we aren't always talking in present tense.
Sometimes, we speak about the past, the future, etc.
Also, the verbs, such has "must", "can", "do", etc. can be used before another verb.

Modify exercice 4 pre-dictionary such that:
- you can add "b" after the pronoun such that the sentence will be "<prounoun> am/are/is <verb>ing" if the verb supports the "-ing". If you don't follow it by a verb, it'll be "<prounoun> am" (don't add an "ing" there)
- you can't add "b" before modal verbs (or phrased differently, you can't place modal verbs after "b")
- you can add "w" after the pronoun, such tha the sentence will be "<prounoun> will ...", it can be placed before the "b" to form "<prounoun> will be <verb>ing"
- you can add "p" to form past tense after the pronoun, suh that the sentence will be "<prounoun> <verb>ed" (or the past tense of the verb), can be placed before the "m", but cannot coexist with "w".
- you can concat modal verbs before another verb. So "must love" would be valid. The verb "do" count both as a modal and a non-modal verb, and things like "she does do" is considered valid.
