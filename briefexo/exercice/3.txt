Now, you want to make some phrasse, after all, you could make all the previous things as easily, if not easier by had.

A classical phrasial example is pronoun + verbs

Make a pre-dictionary on which you can:
- write "i" for "I", "u" for "you", "s" for "she", "h" for "he", "t" for "they"
- On top of that, after there might be "m" for "must", "ho" for "should", "ha" for "shall", "c" for "can", "co" for "could".

Be careful, don't forget the space between the pronouns and the verbs
